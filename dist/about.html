          <h2>About Yayyoo:</h2>
          <p>
            Yeison D. Berdugo is a professional athlete and a professional Mixed
            Martial Arts (MMA)/ Muay Thai fighter. He first discovered his
            passion for health and fitness at the age of 15 while participating
            in High School soccer and track and field. During that high school
            career he competed All-State, All-Divisions, and All-Class;
            recieving multiple trophies and awards - incuding New England MVP.
            This success fueled his passion and drove him to persuing more
            athletic goals, which led him to Martial Arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            He worked hard to achieve his goals. More often than not training
            three times a day - seven days a week. All of the work eventually
            paid off though as he developed a career as a fighter; eventually
            fighting for one of the largest Muay Thai promotions in the United
            States, Lion Fight Promotions. He is still an active fighter for
            Lion Fight currently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Achieving his own goals against the odds inspired him to make
            helping others achieve their goals a personal mission. Through his
            gym and his platform as a fighter he frequently reaches out to the
            youth encouraging them to fight for success and not to let anything
            prevent them from chasing their dreams. He has even brought this
            message into schools, sharing his story and offering living proof
            that anything is possible through hard work, dedication, and
            perseverence. In the future he's looking forward to travelling and
            getting his message out to as many as possible.
